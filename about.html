      <p>
        Engineer of <a class="text" href="https://artsetmetiers.fr/en/school" target="_blank">Arts et Métiers Paristech</a>,
        I continued my studies by a master’s degree in neurosciences at <a class="text" href="https://www.bme-paris.com/bioengineering-and-innovation-in-neurosciences-bin/" target="_blank">BME Paris</a>.
        Graduated since March 2019, I am currently finishing my internship at <a class="text" href="https://www.campusbiotech.ch/index.php/en/node/389" target="_blank">Campus Biotech Geneva</a>, in the Human Neurosciences platform. Our mission is to support research groups by proposing innovative tools or materials through different common support platforms (data analysis, EEG, MRI, VR, Robotics, Neuromodulation, etc.).  My job is to develop easy-to-use EEG signal analysis tools, to make analysis easier   for researchers not having the necessary skills in programming and signal processing.

        I discovered programming with python during my  "classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles". I took a liking to this language and started to explore the countless possibilities it offers, from server creation using Flask or Django, to visualization of data with matplotlib seaborn and bokeh throughmore artistic  libraries such as the blender api or pymidi
        I then began to interest myself in electronics espcially by  arduino and raspberries and started creating connected objects.
        Now I try to use these different tools in various personal or professional projects that I would like to share with you here

      <p>
        My main interests revolve around IoT and data analysis,
        which is why most of the projects I will present here will deal
        with these topics, although I often work on other topics such as
        web dev,  3D modelling , game dev and even Art.

      <p>
        I would try as best I can to explain my work and that it will
        help some of you in your own projects.If you have any question
        or suggestion, do not hesitate to send me an email or to contact
        me on social networks.
